# lyapy
Code for determining the intrinsic Lyman-alpha flux of nearby low-mass
stars and empirically determining their extreme-UV spectrum.

Run the script "LyA_fit_start.py" to test the MCMC on the "p_msl_pan_-----_gj176_panspec_native_resolution_waverange1100.0-1300.0_modAY.fits" spectrum (STIS G140M). Requirements include emcee, triangle, astropy, voigt (voigt.py), and matplotlib.
